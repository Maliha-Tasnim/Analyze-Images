# Analyze-Images
In this project for given two images, we determine if one image is a subset of the other image. Assuming that, they are both JPEG files, that the resolution is the same, as well as the bit depth. First we provide a set of images. The program then return a table showing which images are cropped versions of other images (subset images). For simplication and efficiency the project begins by scaling down the size of the images and removing color information. This gives a much more managable data to deal with. Standard live jpeg library called "lib jpeg turbo." is used in this project to read a jpeg file and prepare it for the comparison.
